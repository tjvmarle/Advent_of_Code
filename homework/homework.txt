Overview of solutions that should/could probably have a much better solution. These are good challenges to solve later
in a more in-depth way, instead of relying too much of some flavour of brute forcing.

 *  Can be brute forced by recursively traversing every possible path without colliding with itself. Could probably be 
    solved by some variant of A* or Dijkstra's, would require converting the grid into nodes somehow. This would allow 
    to eliminate a bunch of paths that would never yield a shorter distance.

    #####                    #####                               
    #...#  is equivalent to  #####                               
    #.#.#    ----------->    #####                               
    #...#                    #...#                               
    #.#.#                    #.#.#                               

    This would also save a ton on duplication beacuse of these branching.
    Each nodes' value can't be determined directly, but the current traversal path can be used as an upper limit. You 
    can skip every future pass with a higher value and lower it when possible.
